Minstall includes some extra scripts, two examples being the benchmark enviroment setup script and the phpMyAdmin script.
These scripts may be used independantly to Minstall and aren't dependant on it.
Some may however require the changing of parameters in the script files to ensure proper setup and operation.
Please be sure to understand what each script does and update the variables in the variable section of each script before using.
Hopefully you'll find the scripts useful!
