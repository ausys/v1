Increasing the upload limit is simple, just follow these steps:

For each user that needs the updated limit append the following to the users config file in /etc/php5/fpm/pool.d/:

php_value[post_max_size] = 200M
php_value[upload_max_filesize] = 200M

Also, to enable the increased limit for nginx create a new .conf file in /etc/nginx/nginx.d/ and insert the following:

client_max_body_size 200M;

Finally, enable the new limit in suhosin by appending the following to /etc/php5/fpm/conf.d/suhosin.ini:

suhosin.memory_limit = 200M

After you're done restart both php-fpm and nginx and you should be good to go!
